This project is part of a presentation for my school job. 

Domotic house project uses some sensors, servomotor, led and a buzzer managed by Arduino to simulate a domotic house and it sends/receives IoT data to/from  a Data warehouse script that runs in a server cloud.
In my demo I used a RasperryPi 4 as server cloud. 

Here you can find the sources of:
 - Arduino software to manage the house
 - Data warehouse script written in Python 
 - Dump of the MySQL database of Data warehouse
